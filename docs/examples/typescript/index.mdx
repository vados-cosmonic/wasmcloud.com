title: "Typescript examples"
---

This section includes examples of [WebAssembly components](/docs/concepts/components.mdx) and [capability providers](/docs/concepts/providers.mdx) for wasmCloud written in [Typescript][ts].

Typescript, being a super set of Javascript has support for WebAssembly via Javascript support for WebAssembly,
which is powered primarily by [`jco`][jco], [`componentize-js`][cjs] and [StarlingMonkey JS Engine][sm] underneath.

All the parts in the JS WebAssembly ecosystem play different roles:

- [StarlingMonkey][sm] is a robust, performant JS engine that compiles to WebAssembly to evaluate Javascript
- [`componentize-js`][cjs] turns Javascript code into WebAssembly components that use the StarlingMonkey engine to execute
- [`jco`][jco] bundles `componentize-js`, generates WIT bindings, and enables WASI components to run in NodeJS and the browser

Examples are automatically propagated from the [`wasmCloud/typescript` repository](https://github.com/wasmCloud/typescript).
