# Building components with Typescript

While most may be familiar with building WebAssembly modules to run in browser contexts, Javascript and Typescript
can also be used to develop WebAssembly components which run everywhere (including on servers and browsers).

This is possible because of a few tools that work together:

- [**StarlingMonkey**][sm] is a robust, performant JS engine that compiles to WebAssembly to evaluate Javascript
- [**ComponentizeJS**][cjs] turns Javascript code into WebAssembly components that use the StarlingMonkey engine to execute
- [**Jco**][jco] bundles `componentize-js`, generates WIT bindings, and enables WASI components to run in [NodeJS][nodejs] and the browser

[cjs]: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-js
[jco]: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/jco
[sm]: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey
[nodejs]: https://nodejs.org/

[`wasmCloud/Typescript`](https://github.com/wasmCloud/typescript/tree/main) contains Typescript ecosystem libraries and
examples that work with wasmCloud, serving as a centralized home for templates, example components, and more.

## Javascript-native tooling, with a little bit of Rust

While [NodeJS][nodejs] uses the WebAssembly runtime available via [V8][v8] (and even contains a somewhat
outdated [`WASI` implementation][nodejs-docs-wasi]), [`jco`][jco], [`componentize-js`][cjs] and [StarlingMonkey][sm] provide and
integrate with the latest in WebAssembly standards and interfaces.

`jco` serves as the primary entrypoint into the WebAssembly Javascript ecosystem, bundling key feature for Javascript development into a single package:

- Building WebAssembly components given Javascript code (possibly transpiled)
- Generating Typescript types to match [WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT)][wit] interfaces
- Transpiling WebAssembly components (from any language) to run in NodeJS or the browser with host bindings

## Get started

In this walkthrough, we will:

1. Create a WebAssembly component that responds to HTTP requests using [Jco][jco]
2. Write a NodeJS host for the WebAssembly component
3. Write tests that ensure the component works

To be able to follow along, you'll need:

* [NodeJS][nodejs]
* [NPM][npm]
* [Jco][npm-jco]
* [componentize-js][npm-cjs]
* [wasmCloud Shell (`wash`)][wash-install] CLI 0.36.1+ for building and deploying components

[npm-jco]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bytecodealliance/jco
[npm-cjs]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@bytecodealliance/componentize-js
[wash-install]: https://wasmcloud.com/docs/installation
[nodejs]: https://nodejs.org
[nodejs]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm

### Step 1: Set up with `wash`

The wasmCloud Shell (`wash`) CLI helps developers build WebAssembly component-based applications that can be deployed with wasmCloud, and
integrates open source tooling to make development easy.

We can use `wash new` to scaffold out a new Typescript project:

```console
wash new component http-test --template-name hello-world-typescript
```

Once the command has completed, you may enter the created `http-ts` folder:

```shell
cd http-test
```

::::warning[Dependencies]
Ensure that you have Javscript development tools like `node` and `npm` installed and available on your PATH.
::::

We can then immediately run `wash build` to build our project as a WebAssembly component:

```console
wash build
```

:::tip
wash places built artifacts in the `build` folder of the current project.
:::

The `wash inspect` subcommand enables us to examine the new component's imports and exports:

```console
wash inspect --wit build/http_hello_world_s.wasm
```

You should see output that looks like the following:

```wit
package root:component;

world root {
  import wasi:io/poll@0.2.3;
  import wasi:clocks/monotonic-clock@0.2.3;
  import wasi:io/error@0.2.3;
  import wasi:io/streams@0.2.3;
  import wasi:http/types@0.2.3;
  import wasi:cli/stdin@0.2.3;
  import wasi:cli/stdout@0.2.3;
  import wasi:cli/stderr@0.2.3;
  import wasi:cli/terminal-input@0.2.3;
  import wasi:cli/terminal-output@0.2.3;
  import wasi:cli/terminal-stdin@0.2.3;
  import wasi:cli/terminal-stdout@0.2.3;
  import wasi:cli/terminal-stderr@0.2.3;
  import wasi:clocks/wall-clock@0.2.3;
  import wasi:filesystem/types@0.2.3;
  import wasi:filesystem/preopens@0.2.3;
  import wasi:random/random@0.2.3;
  import wasi:http/outgoing-handler@0.2.3;

  export wasi:http/incoming-handler@0.2.3;
}
```

:::info
WIT interfaces are a key feature of WebAssembly components -- they enable defining the interface for your
component, and enable advanced functionality not otherwise usable from a WebAssembly module like
filesystem access or serving web requests.

To learn more about WIT interfaces, see the [WIT interface documentation][docs-wit].
To learn more about standardization of WIT interfaces, see the [WebAssebly System Interface (WASI) documentation][wasi].

To modify the WIT interface for the component, see `wit/world.wit`.
:::

Now that the component is built, we can start a local developer loop to use our app locally:

```console
wash dev
```

While `wash dev` won't return, it will have started a HTTP server that you can send requests to.

:::tip
`wash dev` is able to start up a HTTP server automatically because it discovers your application's
dependencies via WIT.
:::

After a second or two, in another console/tab, we can `curl` the application that was deployed locally:

```
$ curl localhost:8000
Hello from Rust!
```

### Step 2: Transpiling our component to run on NodeJS

One important feature of the WebAssembly Javascript tooling is that it can be used as a WebAssembly *host*.

Other hosts utilize WebAssembly runtimes like [`wasmtime`][wasmtime], but since NodeJS runs on V8 which contains it's own WebAssembly
runtime, it's possible to run WebAssembly directly in NodeJS (or browsers with WebAssembly runtimes included).

Since browsers do not yet support WebAssembly components, we can use `jco` to "transpile" components such that they can be run
on browsers.

To transpile our component, let's first create a `dist` folder:

```console
mkdir dist
```

Then, we can run `jco` transpile via [the `npx` shortcut][npx]:

```console
npx jco transpile build/http_hello_world_s.wasm -o dist/transpiled
```

You should see output like the following:

```
  Transpiled JS Component Files:

 - dist/transpiled/http_hello_world_s.core.wasm                 11.1 MiB
 - dist/transpiled/http_hello_world_s.core2.wasm                14.4 KiB

 - dist/transpiled/interfaces/wasi-http-outgoing-handler.d.ts   0.47 KiB
 - dist/transpiled/interfaces/wasi-http-types.d.ts              9.88 KiB
 - dist/transpiled/interfaces/wasi-io-error.d.ts                0.18 KiB
 - dist/transpiled/interfaces/wasi-io-poll.d.ts                 0.25 KiB
 - dist/transpiled/interfaces/wasi-io-streams.d.ts              1.14 KiB
 - dist/transpiled/interfaces/wasi-random-random.d.ts           0.14 KiB
```

After transpiling the WebAssembly component, normally you can use it from JS contexts with code similar to the following:

```js
import { someInterface } from "./dist/transpiled/your-component.js";

const result = someInterface.someFunction(...);
console.log("result", result);
```

**In this case**, since we're using the standardized [`wasi:http`][wasi-http] `incoming-handler` interface, we can
skip creating our own harness to run our HTTP serving WebAssembly component and use `jco serve`:


```console
npx jco serve build/http_hello_world_s.wasm
```

By default `jco serve` will transpile *and* run your component as a web server, and you should see the following output:

```
npx jco serve build/http_hello_world_s.wasm
Server listening on port...
```

You can `curl` `localhost:8000` to trigger your component:

```
curl localhost:8000
Hello from Typescript!
```
